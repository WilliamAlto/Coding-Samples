\noindent 
The goal is to predict the science fiction future of transportation i.e., the effect of driverless cars on the way we travel to and from modern American airport. I'm always being asked, how long until it happens. Well it depends what you mean by it, but something is already happening. The timeline will depend on the specific characteristics of the airport and hundreds of decisions, many of them yet to be made. There will be setbacks (Uber accident and subsequently being shutdown) and partnerships made along the way (Waymo and Jaguar). 
\noindent 
Reason for the questions is to try to answer one important question, where do we put resources. Financial companies want to know where to invest, businesses want to know where to hire and focus their energies, and government needs to know how to build the infrastructure that will be required so that we don't lag, we take full advantage of the efficiencies that this technology will provide.
\noindent 
This necessitates an estimate terminal side traffic, in particular to understand the ebbs and flows of the trains, cars, and busses bringing passengers and staff to the greatest people transportation hubs that have ever been created, the modern airport. The real motivation is to preempt the onslaught to and great change already undergoing such transportation, and prepare these hubs for the driverless car technology that is going to change the world. Data on the terminal side isn't consistently kept or even well understood. Modes differ greatly between airports – while xxx airport has yyy, zzz airport has aaa.

\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{W}e want to accurately predict the future. The specific problem I set out to solve is to precisely estimate the modes we will use to travel to and from major American airports. In particular I am specifically interested in modeling how driverless cars would affect this phenomenon over the course of the next 20 years. This paper is about the answering an easier problem that needed to be solved along the way: what are the best ways to predict total passenger traffic (pax) at a modern American airport in the event of a catastrophic event?
This necessitates an estimate terminal side traffic, in particular to understand the ebbs and flows of the trains, cars, and busses bringing passengers and staff to the greatest people transportation hubs that have ever been created, the modern airport. The real motivation is to preempt the onslaught to and great change already undergoing such transportation, and prepare these hubs for the driverless car technology that is going to change the world. Data on the terminal side isn't kept consistently or even well understood. Modes differ greatly between airports – while xxx airport has yyy, zzz airport has aaa. However, data on passenger traffic has all the characteristics that are necessary for a robust forecast analysis. That is the approach we pursue in this whitepaper.
